##	CONTROL SCHEME
##
##	This control scheme is designed to emulate EQOA as much as possible.
##
##	Of course, M&M requires several more actions than EQOA, such as Jump, Duck,
##	Sit, and has some functions that absolutely require a mouse cursor, like
##	targeting and looting corpses. Therefore extra functions needed to be added
##	to existing buttons, and some had to be moved around a bit to make room.
##
##	To handle all the extra functions needed, each button can perform up to 3
##	actions at any time, accessed by a quick tap, a brief hold, or pressing it
##	while holding L2 (which acts like a modifier key while held). Some buttons
##	also change functionality based on a current "mode", primarily Cursor Mode
##	vs Mouse Look + Abilities mode.
##
##	As much as this was inspired by EQOA, one technically unnecessary change
##	was swapping Circle and Triangle, so Circle is Back/Cancel and Triangle is
##	for using abilities & tool belt. It should be easy enough to search this
##	file for "Circle" and "Triangle" and swap them back though.
##
##	Attack was also changed from a tap to requiring a brief hold to reduce the
##	chance of accidentally attacking a friendly NPC, as well as being moved to
##	Square (to free up the X button for switching to Cursor Mode and clicking
##	with the mouse). Since M&M only has auto-attacking as an option anyway,
##	holding Square briefly to initiate it isn't as cumbersome as it may sound.
##
##	Cursor Mode starts on by default to help with navigating initial screens
##	like login and character select. Once in-game, tap Triangle to turn it off.
##
##	Basic Controls:
##
##	Left Analog Stick - Move character (turn or strafe depending on mode)
##	Right Analog Stick - Move Camera / Turn/ Move Mouse Cursor
##	D-Pad - Navigate menus / abilities / hotspots, (L2) Mouse wheel / zoom
##
##	Circle - (Tap) Cancel/Back/Options Menu, (Hold) Sit
##	Square - (Hold) Auto-attack, (Tap) Interact
##	Triangle - Use Ability / Exit Cursor Mode
##	X - Confirm menu selections / Start Cursor Mode / Left-Click
##		(L2) Alt-click, (L1) Ctrl-click, (R1) Shift-click
##
##	L1 - Target self/group members (see TARGET GROUP layer comments)
##	R1 - (Tap) Target NPCs, (Hold) Hail, (L2) Target PCs, (L2+Hold) Consider
##	L2 - (Tap) Macros Menu, (Hold) Modifies other buttons & shows text labels
##	R2 - Loot Center Screen / Right-Click, (L2) Left-click-drag w/ RStick
##
##	L3 - Auto-run
##	R3 - Jump, (L2) Duck
##	Start - Main Menu, (L2) Toggle Inventory, (L2+Hold) Toggle Bags
##	Select - Toggle NetStats display
##
##	NOTE: Menus (including the Abilities list) can be edited during play by
##	holding the confirm button for that menu for an extended time (D-Pad for
##	Macros, Triangle for Abilities, X for Main Menu).

###############################################################################
##	LOOK MODE
##
##	This mode can be accessed from any other mode by pressing Triangle.
##	It allows controlling the camera with the right thumbstick and move+strafe
##	with the left stick by activating Mouse Look mode (i.e. holding the right
##	mouse button down continuously). This allows for finer camera control than
##	mapping the right analog stick to the digital camera control keys.
##
##	Most importantly, it also gives access to the special slot-machine-style
##	Ability/Spell/Item/Hotbar "menu" (aka Ability List) controlled by D-pad,
##	with contained abilities/etc activated by pressing Triangle.
##
##	To help aim "click center-screen" functions while in 1st-person mode, a
##	reticle is displayed in this mode. If need to loot a corpse, for example,
##	you can aim the reticle at it and tap R2, which will right-click at center-
##	screen to loot the corpse then switch to a special "Loot Mode".

DPad = Select item in Abilities menu
Tap Triangle = Confirm current selection in Abilities menu
LongHold Triangle = Edit current selection in Abilities menu


###############################################################################
##	CURSOR MODE
##
##	This mode can be accessed in multiple ways, but the simplest is to press X.
##	It allows moving the mouse cursor using the right analog stick, while still
##	allowing movement with left stick (but turning instead of strafing).
##
##	It sets X to click the left mouse button, and R2 the right mouse button.
##	Use L2+X for alt-click, L1+X for ctrl-click, and R1+X for shift-click
##	(to get info, single item from stack, and full item stack respectively).
##
##	The D-Pad is used to quickly jump the mouse cursor to defined "hotspots"
##	(which is why the Abilities List is disabled in this mode), which can make
##	navigating some UI windows easier.
##
##	Simply holding L2 for a moment will display name tags for macros and such.
##	If need to left-click-and-drag, which is difficult while holding X since
##	your right thumb is on X instead of the stick, you can use L2+R2 to press
##	and hold the left mouse button and then move the cursor with RStick.

##	LOOT MODE
##
##	This is a slightly modified version of Cursor Mode accessed by pressing R2
##	while in Look Mode to loot a corpse. It allows a cursor jump to the first
##	slot of the loot window when press any direction on the D-Pad. After that,
##	moving forward automatically returns to Look Mode.

###############################################################################
##	TARGET GROUP
##
##	This is used when hold L1 to control targeting your group members
##	(your own character is considered Group Member #1 for group targeting).
##	Sadly, just repeatedly tapping L1 to cycle group members like in EQOA
##	doesn't really work because the overlay app has no way of knowing your
##	current group size (plus that method is slow with 5+ group members)!
##
##	Tap L1 to target a saved "default" target (initially yourself).
##	Hold L1 and use D-pad Up/Down to target prev/next group member,
##	with default target as starting point whenever initially press and hold L1.
##	L1+Right re-targets current group member (meaning may target their pet).
##	L1+Left sets the last group member targeted as new "default" when tap L1.
##	L1+R1 can be set to run an /assist macro by defining the Assist Key Bind.

DPad Right = Re-press last key in TargetGroup array
DPad Left = Set TargetGroup array default to last key pressed
R1 = Assist


###############################################################################
##	MACROS MENU
##
##	This is used when tap L2 to display/control Macros (aka Quick Chat) menu.
##	Basically, each command is assigned a sequence of direction presses, by
##	virtue of D-pad taps instantly selecting and confirming the command or
##	sub-menu in the direction pressed.
##
##	Edit/add/remove macros/sub-menus by holding a direction for a time.
##
##	You can repeatedly use the same macro by pressing and holding L2 again
##	(after tapping it to bring up the menu initially) which prevents the menu
##	from closing when selecting an option with the D-pad.
###############################################################################

LongHold DPad = Edit Macros menu option in direction


###############################################################################
##	MAIN MENU
##
##	Press Start/Options/whatever to bring up the Main Menu controlled here.
##	D-pad Up/Down scrolls through the menu options. Use X to confirm, and
##	Circle to back out of a sub-menu or to close the menu entirely.
##
##	Some menu options will open an in-game UI window, like your Inventory.
##	To interact with these, pressing RStick in any direction will exit the
##	menu and start Cursor Mode. Because of this, Mouse Look mode is disabled
##	and you must use LStick to turn while using this menu.

###############################################################################
##	MEMORIZE ABILITIES
##
##	Accessible from the main menu, this special layer allows for faster ability
##	memorization than just using Cursor Mode controls, by setting hotspots for
##	the ability book and then, when press X to left-click on an ability, using
##	a special menu to select an ability slot to memorize it there (including a
##	right-click first to forget whatever was already in that slot).
##
##	If the book was already open, starting this mode might close it - simply
##	tap LStick Down to bring it back again. You can also use LStick L/R or
##	L1/R1 to flip through the each ability book's pages, and L2/R2 to switch
##	between the different book types (spells, skills, or innate). Using the 
##	right stick to move the mouse exits, since at that point can't know if you
##	are clicking on ability icons or something else with X. Circle returns
##	back to Main Menu.

###############################################################################
##	AUTO-RUN
##
##	While the game has a built-in Auto-Run and could just assign to press that
##	key, it is easy to accidentally drop out of Auto-Run by pressing forward on
##	the left analog stick while steering or while pressing L3. So this layer
##	fixes that by making it so you must hold back on LStick or attempt to sit
##	or duck in order to stop.
