##  BASIC CONTROLS
##
##  This control scheme is designed to emulate that used by the PS2 MMO "EQOA".
##
##  Additional actions not included in EQOA like Jump, Sit, and mouse-dependent
##  tasks like inventory management needed to be added. These extra actions were
##  added by assigning different actions for tapping vs holding a button, or to
##  pressing a button while holding a modifier buton (usually L2, such as using
##  L2+D-Pad for camera zoom). Some buttons will also change their behavior
##  based on a current mode (namely Cursor Mode vs Action Mode).
##
##  The below button name assignments should give an idea of the basic funtion
##  of each button on the gamepad, with comments on their extra functionality.

##  ACTION MODE
##
##  This mode can be accessed while in other modes by pressing <Action>.
##
##  It allows controlling the camera with the right thumbstick and move+strafe
##  with the left stick by activating Mouse Look (holding the right mouse
##  button down continuously). You can also look around while using auto-run
##  or auto-strafe-run (from L3 or L2+L3 respectively) without turning your
##  character by holding L2 while using the right thumbstick.
##
##  Most importantly, it also gives access to the special Ability List menu
##  containing spells, hotbar buttons, etc that is navigated by the D-pad and
##  current selection used by pressing <Action>. Hold <Action> for a while to
##  instead edit the current selection's label and assigned command.
##
##  Tapping <Interact> in this mode uses the Interact key bind, which can
##  open doors, trade with merchant/bank NPCs, and loot corpses without
##  needing to switch to Cursor Mode first. This also does switch to Cursor
##  Mode temporarily to facilitate looting, shopping, etc, however, entering
##  Cursor Mode in this way causes any movement with LStick to automatically
##  return back to Action Mode.

###############################################################################
##  CURSOR MODE
##
##  This mode is usually accessed by pressing <MouseClick> or <Interact>.
##
##  It allows moving the mouse cursor using the right analog stick, while still
##  allowing movement with left stick (but turning instead of strafing).
##
##  <MouseClick> then acts as the left mouse button, and <Interact> as the
##  right mouse button. Use L2+<MouseClick> for alt-click, L1+<MouseClick> for
##  ctrl-click, and R1+<MouseClick> for shift-click, for cases where those are
##  needed (like selling an entire stack of items in one click).
##  Simply holding L2 for a moment will display names of items in bags, etc. 
##
##  The D-Pad is used to quickly jump the mouse cursor to defined "hotspots"
##  (which is why the Abilities List is disabled in this mode), which can make
##  navigating some UI windows easier (namely the Loot and Inventory windows).
##
##  With the default setting of MouseClick = X, both it and the right analog
##  stick are used by your right thumb. This makes using them together for
##  left-click-and-drag quite awkward. To help with this, while holding
##  <MouseClick> the left analog stick will control the mouse cursor as well.

##  TARGET GROUP
##
##  Repeatedly tap <TargetGroup> to cycle through targeting your group members.
##  Your own character is considered the first goup member, even when solo.
##
##  Unfortunately, this app doesn't have any way of knowing your actual current
##  group size, or what you might have targeted (since there are multiple ways
##  of changing targets). This means that even when just in a 2-person group,
##  you'd need to tapping <TargetGroup> 5 times to cycle back to yourself.
##  It also means it is possible to target yourself, then click on another
##  target, and then press <TargetGroup> again and it will target the second
##  group member (meaning no one if solo!) when you meant to target yourself!
##
##  To help solve the first problem, you can instead hold it and use the D-Pad
##  for additional targeting options:
##
##  <TargetGroup>+Up/Down = Target prev/next group member
##  <TargetGroup>+Right = Re-target last targeted group member (i.e. their pet)
##  <TargetGroup>+Left = Set group member as new "default" instead of yourself
##    (like main tank for healer or main assist for DPS)
##
##  For the second problem, a visual indicator HUD element is used to show
##  which group member was last targeted. That member will be used as the
##  starting point for which to target next with further button presses. 
##  The indicator will go away after using certain other commands that *could*
##  result in a change of target (mouse clicks, target N/PC hotkeys, Esc to
##  drop target, etc.) - though the app has no way of knowing for sure if these
##  actually *did* change targets. Once this indicator is gone, the next press
##  will restart at the default group target.
##
##  You can also hold <TargetGroup> and press <TargetOther> to use Assist key.
##  Alternatively, the first time you tap <TargetOther> after targeting any
##  group member besides yourself will use Assist instead of TargetCycleNPC.

##  MACROS MENU
##
##  This special menu appears when tap the <QuickMenu> button (L2).
##
##  Basically, each command is assigned a sequence of direction presses, by
##  virtue of D-pad taps instantly selecting and confirming the command or
##  sub-menu in the direction pressed.
##
##  Edit/add/remove macros/sub-menus by holding a direction for a time.
##
##  You can repeatedly use the same macro by pressing and holding <QuickMenu>
##  once the menu is already open, which prevents it from closing when using
##  the D-pad - instead closing when the button is released. You can also use
##  the face buttons as an alternate to the D-pad when doing this, allowing you
##  to spam a macro while still being able to move around with your thumb on
##  the left analog stick intsead of the D-Pad.
