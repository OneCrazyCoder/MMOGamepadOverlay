## BASIC CONTROLS
##
## This control scheme is designed to emulate that used by the PS2 MMO "EQOA".
##
## Additional actions not included in EQOA like jump, sit, and mouse-dependent
## tasks like inventory management needed to be added by assigning them to
## things like holding a button instead of tapping or to button combinations
## (usually with L2, such as L2+D-Pad to use mouse wheel for camera zoom or
## scrolling chat window text). Some buttons also have different actions for
## different "modes" such as Cursor Mode vs Camera Mode.
##
## Other buttons were swapped from EQOA's layout (like Circle and Triangle),
## but can be swapped back easily if preferred.
##
## Basic Controls:
##
## Left Analog Stick - Move character (turn or strafe depending on mode)
## Right Analog Stick - Move Camera / Turn / Move Mouse Cursor
## D-Pad - Navigate menus / abilities / hotspots, (L2) Mouse wheel / zoom
##         (Hold) Edit macro in Macros menu
##
## Circle - (Tap) Esc/Cancel/Back/Options Menu, (Hold) Sit
## Square - Toggle Auto-attack
## Triangle - Use Ability / Switch to Action Mode
## X - Confirm menu selections / Switch to Cursor Mode / Left-click
##     (L2) Alt-click, (L1) Ctrl-click, (R1) Shift-click
##
## L1 - Target self/pet/group members (see TARGET GROUP section for details)
## R1 - (Tap) Target NPCs, (L2) Target PCs, (Hold) Consider / WhoTarget
## L2 - (Tap) Macros Menu, (Hold) Modify other buttons / show item names
## R2 - Right-click / Interact
##
## L3 - Auto run, (L2) Lock movement (aka auto-strafe-run)
## R3 - Jump, (L2) Duck
## Start - Main Menu, (L2) Toggle Inventory, (L2+Hold) Toggle Bags
## Select - <unused>

###############################################################################
## CAMERA MODE
##
## This mode can be accessed while in other modes by pressing Triangle.
##
## It allows controlling the camera with the right thumbstick and move+strafe
## with the left stick by activating Mouse Look (holding the right mouse
## button down continuously). You can also look around while using auto-run
## or auto-strafe-run (from L3 or L2+L3 respectively) WITHOUT turning your
## character by holding L2 while using the right thumbstick.
##
## Most importantly, it also gives access to the special Ability List menu
## containing spells, hotbar buttons, etc that is navigated by the D-pad and
## current selection used by pressing Triangle. Hold Triangle for a while to
## instead edit the current selection's label and assigned command.
##
## Tapping R2 in this mode uses the Interact key bind, which can open doors,
## trade with merchant/bank NPCs, and loot corpses without needing to switch
## to Cursor Mode first. This also does switch to Cursor Mode temporarily to
## facilitate looting, shopping, etc.

###############################################################################
## CURSOR MODE
##
## This mode is usually accessed by pressing X or R2.
##
## It allows moving the mouse cursor using the right analog stick, while still
## allowing movement with left stick (just turning instead of strafing).
##
## X then acts as the left mouse button, and R2 as the right mouse button.
## Use L2+X for alt-click, L1+X for ctrl-click, and R1+X for shift-click, for
## cases where those are needed (like selling a stack of items in one click).
## Simply holding L2 for a moment will display names of items in bags, etc.
##
## The D-Pad is used as an alternate, faster method of moving the mouse that
## "jumps" the cursor in the direction pressed. It can actually be more
## accurate than using the right analog stick when used while the cursor is
## near active "hotspot" positions, which it will prefer to jump to directly.
## These hotspots are set to commonly-accessed positions such as item slots in
## the Loot Window and the Inventory window.
##
## While holding X (left-click), the left analog stick will also move the
## cursor (since your right thumb is busy holding X instead of right stick).

###############################################################################
## TARGET GROUP
##
## Repeatedly tap L1 to cycle through targeting yourself and group members.
##
## Unfortunately, this app doesn't have any way of knowing your actual current
## group size, or what you might have targeted (since there are multiple ways
## of changing targets). This means that even when just in a 2-person group,
## you'll need to tap L1 5 times to cycle back to yourself. As a workaround for
## this, you can instead hold L1 and use the D-Pad:
##
## L1+Up/Down = Target prev/next group member
## L1+Right = Re-target last targeted group member (or their/your pet)
## L1+Left = Set group member as new "default" instead of yourself
##           (like main tank for healer or main assist for DPS)
##
## A visual indicator HUD element is used to show which group member was last
## targeted. That member will be used as the starting point for which to target
## next with Tap L1 or L1+Up/Down. The indicator will go away after using other
## commands that *could* result in a change of target (mouse clicks, cycle
## target keys, Esc to drop target, etc.). If the indicator is gone, the next
## L1 press will restart at the default group target (likely yourself).
##
## You can also hold L1 and press R1 to use the set 'Assist' KeyBind.
## Alternatively, the first time you tap R1 after targeting any group member
## (besides yourself) will use 'Assist' instead of 'TargetCycleNPC'

##
## Some menu options will open an in-game UI window, like your Inventory.
## To interact with these, pressing RStick in any direction will exit the
## menu and switch to Cursor Mode. Because of this, Mouse Look is disabled
## and you must use the left analog stick to steer while using this menu.

## forgetting whatever was already in that slot via a right-click).
##
## If the book was already open, starting this menu might close it - simply
## tap LStick Down to bring it back again. You can also use LStick L/R or
## L1/R1 to flip through the ability book pages. Since the mouse cursor will
## move with the menu selection, you can hold R2 to right-click-and-hold in
## order to inspect an ability. Using RStick cancels to Cursor Mode.
