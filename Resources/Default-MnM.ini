##	CONTROL SCHEME
##
##	This control scheme is designed to emulate EQOA as much as possible.
##
##	Of course, M&M requires several more actions than EQOA, such as Jump, Duck,
##	Sit, and has some functions that absolutely require a mouse cursor, like
##	targeting and looting corpses. Therefore extra functions needed to be added
##	to existing buttons, and some had to be moved around a bit to make room.
##
##	To handle all the extra functions needed, each button can perform up to 3
##	actions at any time, accessed by a quick tap, a brief hold, or pressing it
##	while holding L2 (which acts like a modifier key while held). Some buttons
##	also change functionality based on a current "mode", primarily Cursor Mode
##	vs Mouse Look + Abilities mode.
##
##	As much as this was inspired by EQOA, one technically unnecessary change
##	was swapping Circle and Triangle, so Circle is Back/Cancel and Triangle is
##	for using abilities & tool belt. It should be easy enough to search this
##	file for "Circle" and "Triangle" and swap them back though.
##
##	Attack was also changed from a tap to requiring a brief hold to reduce the
##	chance of accidentally attacking a friendly NPC, as well as being moved to
##	Square (to free up the X button for switching to Cursor Mode and clicking
##	with the mouse). Since M&M only has auto-attacking as an option anyway,
##	holding Square briefly to initiate it isn't as cumbersome as it may sound.
##
##	Cursor Mode starts on by default to help with navigating initial screens
##	like login and character select. Once in-game, tap Triangle to turn it off.
##
##	Basic Controls:
##
##	Left Analog Stick - Move character (turn or strafe depending on mode)
##	Right Analog Stick - Move Camera / Turn/ Move Mouse Cursor
##	D-Pad - Navigate menus / abilities / hotspots, (L2) Mouse wheel / zoom
##
##	Circle - (Tap) Cancel/Back/Options Menu, (Hold) Sit
##	Square - (Hold) Auto-attack, (Tap) Interact
##	Triangle - Use Ability / Exit Cursor Mode
##	X - Confirm menu selections / Start Cursor Mode / Left-Click
##		(L2) Alt-click, (L1) Ctrl-click, (R1) Shift-click
##
##	L1 - Target self/pet/group members (see TARGET GROUP layer comments)
##	R1 - (Tap) Target NPCs, (L2) Target PCs, (Hold) Consider / WhoTarget
##	L2 - (Tap) Macros Menu, (Hold) Modifies other buttons & shows text labels
##	R2 - Right-Click / Loot Center Screen
##
##	L3 - Auto-run
##	R3 - Jump, (L2) Duck
##	Start - Main Menu, (L2) Toggle Inventory, (L2+Hold) Toggle Bags
##	Select - Toggle game stats display
##
##	NOTE: Menus (including the Abilities list) can be edited during play by
##	holding the confirm button for that menu for an extended time (D-Pad for
##	Macros, Triangle for Abilities, X for Main Menu).

###############################################################################
##	LOOK MODE
##
##	This mode can be accessed from any other mode by pressing Triangle.
##	It allows controlling the camera with the right thumbstick and move+strafe
##	with the left stick by activating Mouse Look mode (i.e. holding the right
##	mouse button down continuously). This allows for finer camera control than
##	mapping the right analog stick to the digital camera control keys.
##
##	Most importantly, it also gives access to the special slot-machine-style
##	Ability/Spell/Item/Hotbar "menu" (aka Ability List) controlled by D-pad,
##	with contained abilities/etc activated by pressing Triangle.
##
##	To help aim "click center-screen" functions while in 1st-person mode, a
##	reticle is displayed in this mode. If need to loot a corpse, for example,
##	you can aim the reticle at it and tap R2, which will right-click at center-
##	screen to loot the corpse then switch to a special "Loot Mode".

###############################################################################
##	CURSOR MODE
##
##	This mode can be accessed in multiple ways, but the simplest is to press X.
##	It allows moving the mouse cursor using the right analog stick, while still
##	allowing movement with left stick (but turning instead of strafing).
##
##	It sets X to click the left mouse button, and R2 the right mouse button.
##	Use L2+X for alt-click, L1+X for ctrl-click, and R1+X for shift-click
##	(to get info, single item from stack, and full item stack respectively).
##	Simply holding L2 for a moment will display names of items in bags, etc. 
##
##	The D-Pad is used to quickly jump the mouse cursor to defined "hotspots"
##	(which is why the Abilities List is disabled in this mode), which can make
##	navigating some UI windows easier.
##
##	Since both X and R-Stick are used by your right thumb, using them together
##	for left-click-and-drag can be quite awkward. To help with tihs, while
##	holding X the L-Stick will temporarily control the mouse cursor as well.

##	LOOT MODE
##
##	This is a slightly modified version of Cursor Mode accessed by pressing R2

##	moving forward automatically returns to Look Mode.

##	TARGET GROUP
##
##	Repeatedly tap L1 to cycle through targeting yourself and group members.
##
##	Unfortunately, this app doesn't have any way of knowing your actual current
##	group size, or what you might have targeted (since there are multiple ways
##	of changing targets). This means that even when just in a 2-person group,
##	you need to tap L1 5 times to cycle back to yourself. It also means it is
##	possible to target yourself with L1, then click on another target, and then
##	press L1 again and it will target group member #2 (no one if solo!) when you
##	would expect it to target yourself again.
##
##	To help solve the first problem, you can instead hold L1 and use the D-Pad
##	for additional targeting options:
##
##	L1+Up/Down = Target prev/next group member
##	L1+Right = Re-target last targeted group member (or their/your pet)
##	L1+Left = Set group member as new "default" instead of yourself
##		(like your main tank for quicker healing or /assist)
##
##	For the second problem, a visual indicator HUD element is used to show
##	which group member was last targeted. That member will be used as the
##	starting point for which to target next with Tap L1 or L1+Up/Down. 
##	The indicator will go away after not pressing L1 for a while, or after
##	using certain other buttons that could result in a change of target
##	(R1, R2, Square, X in Cursor Mode, Circle, or L2+L1). Once it is gone,
##	the next L1 press will restart at the default target (initially yourself).
##
##	NOTE: You can also hold L1 and press R1 to use the set 'Assist' Key Bind!

##	MACROS MENU
##
##	This is used when tap L2 to display/control Macros (aka Quick Chat) menu.
##	Basically, each command is assigned a sequence of direction presses, by
##	virtue of D-pad taps instantly selecting and confirming the command or
##	sub-menu in the direction pressed.
##
##	Edit/add/remove macros/sub-menus by holding a direction for a time.
##
##	You can repeatedly use the same macro by pressing and holding L2 again
##	(after tapping it to bring up the menu initially) which prevents the menu
##	from closing when selecting an option with the D-pad, instead closing when
##	release L2. You can also use the face buttons as an alternate to the D-pad
##	when doing this, allowing you to spam a macro while still being able to
##	moving around using the LStick.

##
##	Some menu options will open an in-game UI window, like your Inventory.
##	To interact with these, pressing RStick in any direction will exit the

##	right-click first to forget whatever was already in that slot).
##
##	If the book was already open, starting this mode might close it - simply

##	L1/R1 to flip through the each ability book's pages, and L2/R2 to switch
##	between the different book types (spells, skills, or innate). Using the 
##	right stick to move the mouse exits, since at that point can't know if you
