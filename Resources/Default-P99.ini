##	CONTROL SCHEME
##
##	This control scheme is designed to emulate EQOA as much as possible.
##
##	Of course, EQ1 requires several more actions than EQOA, such as Jump, Duck,
##	Sit, and has some functions that absolutely require a mouse cursor, like
##	targeting and looting corpses. Therefore extra functions needed to be added
##	to existing buttons, and some had to be moved around a bit to make room.
##
##	To handle all the extra functions needed, some buttons perform different
##	actions for being tapped (pressed and released again quickly) vs held for
##	a brief moment. Other functions may alse be accessed by holding a modifier
##	button (usually L2) while pressing a button, such as using L2+R3 to Duck.
##	Finally, some buttons change function based on a current "mode" - primarily
##	"Cursor Mode" vs "Action Mode", but also some menu-controlling modes.
##
##	As much as this was inspired by EQOA, one technically unnecessary change
##	was swapping Circle and Triangle, so Circle is Back/Cancel and Triangle is
##	for using abilities & tool belt, to be more in-line with modern games.
##	If you prefer, add the following lines to your profile to swap them back:
##	[Gamepad]
##	Triangle = Circle
##	Circle = Triangle
##
##	Attack was also changed to no longer be possible with just a button tap,
##	instead requiring a brief hold to toggle auto-attack on and off. This helps
##	reduce the chance of accidentally attacking a friendly NPC. It was also
##	moved from X to Square (to free up the X button to use for left-clicks in
##	Cursor Mode), but there isn't really a standard "talk to NPC" button to
##	assign to Square anyway (you'll still have to use your keyboard for that).
##
##	Basic Controls:
##
##	Left Analog Stick - Move character (turn or strafe depending on mode)
##	Right Analog Stick - Move Camera / Turn / Move Mouse Cursor
##	D-Pad - Navigate menus / abilities / hotspots, (L2) Mouse wheel / zoom
##
##	Circle - (Tap) Cancel/Back, (Hold) Sit
##	Square - (Hold) Auto-attack, (Tap) Click Center Screen
##	Triangle - Use Ability / Switch to Action Mode
##	X - Confirm menu selections / Switch to Cursor Mode / Left-click
##		(L2) Alt-click, (L1) Ctrl-click, (R1) Shift-click
##
##	L1 - Target self/pet/group members (see TARGET GROUP section for details)
##	R1 - (Tap) Target NPCs, (L2) Target PCs, (Hold) Consider / WhoTarget
##	L2 - (Tap) Macros Menu, (Hold) Modify other buttons / show item names
##	R2 - Right-click / Loot Center Screen, (L2) Loc/Sense Heading
##
##	L3 - (Tap) Auto run, (L2) Lock movement (aka auto-strafe-run)
##		 (Hold) Re-center 1st-person camera
##	R3 - Jump, (L2) Duck
##	Start - Main Menu, (L2) Toggle Inventory, (L2+Hold) Toggle Bags
##	Select - Change camera mode
##
##	NOTE: Menus (including the Abilities list) can be edited during play by
##	holding the confirm button for that menu for an extended time (D-Pad for
##	Macros, Triangle for Abilities, X for basic menus).

##	ACTION MODE
##
##	This mode can be accessed from most other modes by pressing Triangle.
##	It allows controlling the camera with the right thumbstick and move+strafe
##	with the left stick by activating Mouse Look (holding the right mouse
##	button down continuously). This allows for finer camera control than
##	mapping the right analog stick to the digital camera control keys.
##
##	Most importantly, it also gives access to the special Ability List menu
##	containing spells, hotbar buttons, etc that is navigated by the D-pad and
##	current selection used by pressing Triangle.
##
##	A reticle is displayed while in this mode at the CenterScreen hotspot,
##	which can be used to know where mouse clicks will occur when tap Square
##	or R2. Tapping Square simply clicks there, which can be used for targeting
##	or opening doors. Tapping R2 right-clicks instead, and is mostly intended
##	for looting corpses. As such, it will also change to a special "Loot Mode"
##	to aid in faster looting (see LOOT MODE section for details).

###############################################################################
##	CURSOR MODE
##
##	This mode can be accessed in multiple ways, but the simplest is to press X.
##	It allows moving the mouse cursor using the right analog stick, while still
##	allowing movement with left stick (but turning instead of strafing).
##
##	It sets X to click the left mouse button, and R2 the right mouse button.
##	Use L2+X for alt-click, L1+X for ctrl-click, and R1+X for shift-click for
##	cases where those are needed (like getting single items from a stack).
##	Simply holding L2 for a moment will display names of items in bags, etc. 
##
##	The D-Pad is used to quickly jump the mouse cursor to defined "hotspots"
##	(which is why the Abilities List is disabled in this mode), which can make
##	navigating some UI windows easier (namely the Loot and Inventory windows).
##
##	Since both X and R-Stick are used by your right thumb, using them together
##	for left-click-and-drag can be quite awkward. To help with this, while
##	holding X the left analog stick changes to controlling the mouse cursor.

##	LOOT MODE
##
##	This is a slightly modified version of Cursor Mode accessed by tapping R2

##	first slot of the Loot Window the first time press any direction on the
##	D-pad, but after that controls the same as Cursor Mode. Moving forward in
##	this mode will also automatically return to Action Mode for convenience.

##	TARGET GROUP
##
##	Repeatedly tap L1 to cycle through targeting yourself and group members.
##
##	Unfortunately, this app doesn't have any way of knowing your actual current
##	group size, or what you might have targeted (since there are multiple ways
##	of changing targets). This means that even when just in a 2-person group,
##	you'd need to tap L1 5 times to cycle back to yourself. It also means it is
##	possible to target yourself with L1, then click on another target, and then
##	press L1 again and it will target group member #2 (no one if solo!) when you
##	would expect it to target yourself again.
##
##	To help solve the first problem, you can instead hold L1 and use the D-Pad
##	for additional targeting options:
##
##	L1+Up/Down = Target prev/next group member
##	L1+Right = Re-target last targeted group member (or their/your pet)
##	L1+Left = Set group member as new "default" instead of yourself
##		(like main tank for healer or main assist for DPS)
##
##	For the second problem, a visual indicator HUD element is used to show
##	which group member was last targeted. That member will be used as the
##	starting point for which to target next with Tap L1 or L1+Up/Down. 
##	The indicator will go away after using certain other commands that *could*
##	result in a change of target (mouse clicks, target N/PC hotkeys, Esc to
##	drop target, etc.) - though the app has no way of knowing for sure if these
##	actually *did* change targets. Once this indicator is gone, the next L1
##	press will restart at the default group target.
##
##	You can also hold L1 and press R1 to use the set 'Assist' KeyBind.
##	Alternatively, the first time you tap R1 after targeting any group member
##	besides yourself will use 'Assist' instead of 'TargetCycleNPC'

##	MACROS MENU
##
##	This is used when tap L2 to display/control the Macros (Quick Chat) menu.
##	Basically, each command is assigned a sequence of direction presses, by
##	virtue of D-pad taps instantly selecting and confirming the command or
##	sub-menu in the direction pressed.
##
##	Edit/add/remove macros/sub-menus by holding a direction for a time.
##
##	You can repeatedly use the same macro by pressing and holding L2 again
##	(after tapping it to bring up the menu initially) which prevents the menu
##	from closing when selecting an option with the D-pad - instead closing when
##	release L2. You can also use the face buttons as an alternate to the D-pad
##	when doing this, allowing you to spam a macro while still being able to
##	move around with your thumb on the left analog stick intsead of the D-Pad.
