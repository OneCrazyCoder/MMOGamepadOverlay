## CONTROL SCHEME
##
## This control scheme is designed to emulate that used by the PS2 MMO "EQOA".
##
## Additional actions not included in EQOA like Jump, Sit, and mouse-dependent
## tasks like inventory management needed to be added. These extra actions were
## added by assigning different actions for tapping vs holding a button, or to
## pressing a button while holding a modifier button (usually L2, such as
## "L2+D-Pad" for camera zoom). Some buttons will also change their behavior
## based on a current mode (namely Cursor Mode vs Action Mode).
##
## For EQOA players: I also swapped some face buttons to align more with most
## modern game layouts. Circle is Back/Cancel, Triangle is abilities, Square
## toggles auto-attack, and X is "interact" (click left mouse button).
##
## Basic Controls:
##
## Left Analog Stick - Move character (turn or strafe depending on mode)
## Right Analog Stick - Move Camera / Turn / Move Mouse Cursor
## D-Pad - Navigate menus / abilities / hotspots, (L2) Mouse wheel / zoom
##     (Hold) Edit macro in Macros menu
##
## Circle - (Tap) Cancel/Back, (Hold) Sit
## Square - Toggle Auto-attack
## Triangle - Use Ability / Switch to Action Mode
## X - Confirm menu selections / Switch to Cursor Mode / Left-click
##   (L2) Alt-click, (L1) Ctrl-click, (R1) Shift-click
##
## L1 - Target self/pet/group members (see TARGET GROUP section for details)
## R1 - (Tap) Target NPCs, (L2) Target PCs, (Hold) Consider / WhoTarget
## L2 - (Tap) Macros Menu, (Hold) Modify other buttons / show item names
## R2 - Right-click / Use/Loot Center Screen, (L2) Loc/Sense Heading
##
## L3 - (Tap) Auto run, (L2) Lock movement (aka auto-strafe-run)
##    (Hold) Re-center 1st-person camera
## R3 - Jump, (L2) Duck
## Start - Main Menu, (L2) Toggle Inventory, (L2+Hold) Toggle Bags
## Select - (Tap) Change camera mode, (Hold) Alt camera controls

## ACTION MODE
##
## This mode can be accessed from most other modes by pressing Triangle.
## It allows controlling the camera with the right thumbstick and move+strafe
## with the left stick by activating Mouse Look (holding the right mouse
## button down continuously). This allows for finer camera control than
## mapping the right analog stick to the digital camera control keys.
##
## Most importantly, it also gives access to the special Ability List menu
## containing spells, hotbar buttons, etc that is navigated by the D-pad and
## current selection used by pressing Triangle.
##
## A reticle is displayed while in this mode at the CenterScreen hotspot,
## which can be used to know where mouse clicks will occur when tap R2.
## Tapping R2 left-clicks then right-clicks here, which can be used for
## opening doors, dealing with merchant/bank, and looting corpses without
## needing to switch to Cursor Mode first. It also does itself switch to
## Cursor Mode temporarily to facilitate looting, shopping, etc, however,
## once enter Cursor Mode by tapping R2, moving with LStick automatically
## returns back to Action Mode.

###############################################################################
## CURSOR MODE
##
## This mode can be accessed in multiple ways, but the simplest is to press X.
## It allows moving the mouse cursor using the right analog stick, while still
## allowing movement with left stick (but turning instead of strafing).
##
## It sets X to click the left mouse button, and R2 the right mouse button.
## Use L2+X for alt-click, L1+X for ctrl-click, and R1+X for shift-click for
## cases where those are needed (like getting single items from a stack).
## Simply holding L2 for a moment will display names of items in bags, etc.
##
## The D-Pad is used to quickly jump the mouse cursor to defined "hotspots"
## (which is why the Abilities List is disabled in this mode), which can make
## navigating some UI windows easier (namely the Loot and Inventory windows).
##
## Since both X and R-Stick are used by your right thumb, using them together
## for left-click-and-drag can be quite awkward. To help with this, while
## holding X the left analog stick changes to controlling the mouse cursor.

## TARGET GROUP
##
## Repeatedly tap L1 to cycle through targeting yourself and group members.
##
## Unfortunately, this app doesn't have any way of knowing your actual current
## group size, or what you might have targeted (since there are multiple ways
## of changing targets). This means that even when just in a 2-person group,
## you'd need to tap L1 5 times to cycle back to yourself. It also means it is
## possible to target yourself with L1, then click on another target, and then
## press L1 again and it will target group member #2 (no one if solo!) when you
## would expect it to target yourself again.
##
## To help solve the first problem, you can instead hold L1 and use the D-Pad
## for additional targeting options:
##
## L1+Up/Down = Target prev/next group member
## L1+Right = Re-target last targeted group member (or their/your pet)
## L1+Left = Set group member as new "default" instead of yourself
##   (like main tank for healer or main assist for DPS)
##
## For the second problem, a visual indicator HUD element is used to show
## which group member was last targeted. That member will be used as the
## starting point for which to target next with Tap L1 or L1+Up/Down.
## The indicator will go away after using certain other commands that *could*
## result in a change of target (mouse clicks, target N/PC hotkeys, Esc to
## drop target, etc.) - though the app has no way of knowing for sure if these
## actually *did* change targets. Once this indicator is gone, the next L1
## press will restart at the default group target.
##
## You can also hold L1 and press R1 to use the set 'Assist' KeyBind.
## Alternatively, the first time you tap R1 after targeting any group member
## besides yourself will use 'Assist' instead of 'TargetCycleNPC'

## MACROS MENU
##
## This is used when tap L2 to display/control the Macros (Quick Chat) menu.
## Basically, each command is assigned a sequence of direction presses, by
## virtue of D-pad taps instantly selecting and confirming the command or
## sub-menu in the direction pressed.
##
## Edit/add/remove macros/sub-menus by holding a direction for a time.
##
## You can repeatedly use the same macro by pressing and holding L2 again
## (after tapping it to bring up the menu initially) which prevents the menu
## from closing when selecting an option with the D-pad - instead closing when
## release L2. You can also use the face buttons as an alternate to the D-pad
## when doing this, allowing you to spam a macro while still being able to
## move around with your thumb on the left analog stick intsead of the D-Pad.
