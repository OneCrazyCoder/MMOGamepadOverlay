/*
	Tracks and updates the current state of all active menus based on input
	from InputTranslator and configuration from InputMap/Profile.

	Each menu has a Style that defines both its behavior (how menu-related
	commands are interpreted) and its visual layout (used by WindowPainter).

	Commands only reference the root menu ID's directly, so this module uses
	root menu ID's externally and tracks the currently active sub-menu for
	each root menu's stack stored internally.
